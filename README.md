This is a simple Web site for selling honey products, currently on localhost.
There is "register" option for new users, after its completion users will be able to place an order. Of course, users can login with their username and password any time they want. 

To see all the features of this Web site, you can download the files and locally host it. (e.g. download files into htdocs folder of Xampp and create database with the same name as defined in code).

## Front-end

For design of Web site I used HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
